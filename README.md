# 3DGame
<b>Introduction</b><br>
I am Ghercioglo ”Romeon0” Roman, student in Romania, 22 old. This is my side project that I create for fun. I am working alone, all code(with some exceptions) is wrote by me. This project is my first try to make a 3D game, so far I wrote some games like 2D zombie shooter(very lagged if honest), the first game(in console) Snake and some kind of server-client game like Agar.io. Yes, does not inspire...

<b>About</b><br>
- Theme for this project is not very clear now, but main idea to make big world and style like in Fallout, craft system and building like Minecraft and territory war that looks a bit like Stronghold Crusader. I said it is unclean now. Now I am working on base system. 
- Programming language is C++ and graphic library OpenGL. 
- Libraries: glfw, glew, assimp, stb 

<b>Last words</b><br>
At the moment (june 2018) it has basic player movement system, working animations, basic drawing system and path finding.
